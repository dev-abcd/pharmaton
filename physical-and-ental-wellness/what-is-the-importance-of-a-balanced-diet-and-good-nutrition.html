                                    While most of us try to eat well, it can be challenging to eat perfectly every day.
                                    Not only that, in our busy lives, we are often under constant pressure and stress,
                                    as well as being exposed to toxins, heavy metals, pesticides, chemicals, pollution
                                    and radiation. All of these things impact our overall health and wellbeing, and can
                                    deplete our bodies of essential nutrients.

                                Why do we need vitamins and minerals and what do they do?

                                    Good quality nutrition is fundamental to our overall sense of health and wellbeing.
                                    Vitamins and minerals are in the foods that we eat, and our body needs them to grow,
                                    develop, function and thrive in <span

                                    Most vitamins and minerals need to
                                    be obtained through our diet as our body cannot make them. Considering each vitamin
                                    has a specific role or many essential roles to play in our body, it’s easy to see
                                    why good nutrition is important.

                                    <p>Calcium is vital for strong, healthy bones and teeth and the healthy functioning
                                        of your muscles. Calcium is in dairy products (milk, yoghurt and cheese), green

                                    <p>Vitamin C supports your immune system and helps form collagen, which is essential
                                        for healthy bones, gums and blood vessels. Good sources of vitamin C include
                                        citrus fruits (lemons, limes and grapefruit), strawberries and broccoli.</p>
